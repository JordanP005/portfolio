        <p>
          I enjoy designing and developing projects and make sure my work is of
          the best quality. I am always looking for exciting projects to be a
          part of and work on. My field of expertise includes HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, SQL, MongoDB, Bootstrap and React.js as my main framework.
          I enjoy taking on challenges and am willing to go through grit to
          ensure client satisfaction.
